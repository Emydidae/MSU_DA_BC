# Terminal

Now, it's your turn to do some work in the terminal. You'll create three folders and a pair of Python files to print strings of your own creation to the console.

## Instructions

Use the following instructions to write commands in your terminal:

* Create a folder called `LearnPython`.
> mkdir LearnPython

* Navigate into the folder.
> cd LearnPython

* Inside `LearnPython`, create another folder called `Assignment1`.
> mkdir Assignment1

* Inside `Assignment1`, create a file called `quick_python.py`.
> cd Assignment1
> touch quick_python.py

* Add a print statement to `quick_python.py`.
> explorer quick_python.py
> <add the statement>

* Run `quick_python.py`.
> py quick_python.py

* Return to the `LearnPython` folder.
> cd ..

* Inside `LearnPython`, create another folder called `Assignment2`.
> mkdir Assignment2

* Inside `Assignment2`, create a file called `quick_python2.py`.
> cd Assignment2
> touch quick_python2

* Add a different print statement to `quick_python2.py`.
> <add the statement>

* Run `quick_python2.py`.
