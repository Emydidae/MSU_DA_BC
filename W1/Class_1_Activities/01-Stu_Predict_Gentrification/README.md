# Predicting Gentrification

This thought experiment will explore **gentrification**, a social phenomenon where affluent people move to lower-income neighborhoods.

## Instructions

In your groups, discuss the following questions:

* What signs might indicate that gentrification is happening?
* Crime statistics
* Property taxes
* School related stats?
* Literal visual examples
* Average income

* What means can we use to determine how long the trend has been happening?
* Public records

* What proxies might we use to identify gentrification in nonobvious ways?
* Uber /  other "safer" transit
* Grocery-related info - higher spending
* Beautification
* New businesses
* Voting changes

* How might you create a visualization of this data to best “tell the story”?
* Combine literal visuals w/ graphic data
* Consistent story (keep stats ascending or descending)

Pay special attention to details like:

* What data will you use to build your model?
* Publicly available data
* Data pulled by APIs
* Data from companies

* How will you retrieve the data?
* See above

* What is your final “story”?
* Identify the literal "asks" of gentrification, things that show it
*   What kind of problem are you trying to solve?
* Interpret that as a Data Science problem, how to find / collect / arrange data
* Data Analytics - how to show
